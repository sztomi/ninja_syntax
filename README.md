# ninja_syntax

This is a port of ninja_syntax.py to Rust. It allows you to easily emit ninja build files from
Rust with a syntax that is pretty similar to the official python module from the ninja repo.

## Example

```rust
use ninja_syntax::*;
use std::path::Path;

fn main() {
  let mut nw = NinjaWriter(Path::new("build.ninja"));
  nw.comment("Hello this is a comment");
  nw.newline();

  let rule = NinjaRule::new("cc", "cc $in -o $out");
  nw.rule(&rule);

  let mut build = NinjaBuild::new(&["test.o"], "cc");
  build.inputs(&["test.c"]);
  nw.build(&build);

  // write the file to disk
  nw.close().unwrap();
}
```

Originally written by [Tobias Hieta][1], forked and licensed under MIT (with permission from the

ergonomic and to use `textwrap` instead of a custom implementation of word wrapping. Finally, to
apply the *correct* indentation (which is two spaces). Originally part of [sa_ninja_gen][2], now 
being published as a separate crate.
